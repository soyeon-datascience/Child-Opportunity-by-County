## Ty’s Data Sets

1.  Spotify
      - [Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-spotify-tracks-of-2018)
      - [Dataset 1 part 2](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data_by_artist.csv)
          - This is the forerunner for favorite data set
          - Novel idea and data
          - Plenty of variables and observations
          - Maybe a bit too novel making it hard for EDA?
2.  Education Spending
      - [Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-educational-finances)
          - Interesting data because education is important especially in
            current political climate
          - Tonnar found a broader dataset maybe merge them together?

## Jay’s Data Sets

1.  Russian Election
      - [Dataset 1](https://figshare.com/articles/kobakEtAl_AOAS2016_suppData_zip/3126883)
          - Most creative data set
          - Arguably most interesting
          - Too hard to work with unfortunately
2.  BMI Information
      - [Dataset 2](http://www.ncdrisc.org/data-downloads-adiposity.html)
          - Fairly intriguing this is a big health crisis
          - May be a bit too one dimensional to work

## Soyeon’s Data Sets

1.  Youtube
      - [Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new?select=USvideos.csv)
          - Very interesting shows what can lead to various hits
          - Possible second choice however other countries data is in
            the native language
2.  Baby Names
      - [Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-most-popular-baby-names?select=most-popular-baby-names-by-sex-and-mothers-ethnic-group-new-york-city.csv)
          - The data itself is very interesting because its novel
          - Not even ways to slice the data for this project

      - [Dataset 1](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/population-health-metrics-research-consortium-gold-standard-verbal-autopsy-data-2005-2011)
          - Too serious for this project
          - Amount of data is overwhelming nearly 1m observations
2.  Childhood Education
      - [Dataset 2](http://data.diversitydatakids.org/dataset/coi20-child-opportunity-index-2-0-database/resource/f16fff12-b1e5-4f60-85d3-3a0ededa30a0)
          - Interesting data b/c education is important in current
            political climate
          - Second place
          - Great number of variables allowing for interesting analysis
          - Too many rows would have to considerably cut down the data
